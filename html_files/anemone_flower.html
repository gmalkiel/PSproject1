    <h3>The anemone flower was declared the official flower of Israel in 2013, so we set out to
        investigate what is special about this flower</h3>
    <h2>So who are you an anemone?</h2>
    <h3  class="anemone_headlines">Latin/scientific name:</h3> Anemone Coronary.
        <br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="anemone_headlines">Color:</h3> Very varied, although red is the most common.
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="anemone_headlines">Distribution:</h3> Very common in Israel, on the shores of the
    Galilee, Samaria, the Lowlands,<br>the Upper Galilee, the Lower Galilee, the Jezreel Valley, the
    Judean Mountains, the northern Negev,<br> the Negev Mountain, the Hula, the Beit Shean Valley,
    the Judean Desert, the Hermon, the Golan.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="anemone_headlines">Characteristics:</h3> a perennial plant with a tuber, from the
    Nurit family. Besides red, there are plenty of shades of petals - white, pink, blue and purple.
    <br>
    <br>

    the petals open in the morning and close<br> in the evening. In Israel, it is a single species.
    The anemone was severely damaged in Israel by massive<br> harvesting and almost became
    extinct in
    the 1950s. The disappearance of the anemone and other flowers<br> was the motive for the
    acceleration of the legal and educational actions for the conservation of wildflowers,<br> and
    indeed these actions were quite successful.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="anemone_headlines">Interesting details:</h3>  The Hebrew name was given to him by
    Emanuel Laff, a great researcher of Hebrew names.<br>
    The ancestors of the plants (lived in Hungary between 1854 and 1944), thanks to the flower that
    flaunts itself as a bride, and follows the Talmudic name Klonita.
